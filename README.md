# **Data Science Portfolio**

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for  self learning and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Python files.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
- Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
- Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

- ## MLops: End to End ML Lifecycle Projects
  - [Facebook Ad Analytics & AI Assistant](https://github.com/Pruthvish-Vyas/Facebook-Ad-Analytics-AI-Assistant): Facebook Ad Analytics AI Assistant is a Python-based tool designed to enhance and automate the analysis of Facebook advertising campaign data. Leveraging AI-driven insights, this assistant streamlines data processing, uncovers actionable trends, and supports marketing teams in optimizing their ad strategies for better ROI. 
  - [Google Analytics Dashboard & Predictor](https://github.com/Pruthvish-Vyas/End-to-End-Google-Analytics-model-building): Developed an end-to-end Google Analytics model using Jupyter Notebook and Python, focusing on data extraction, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The project demonstrates a full workflow from raw analytics data to actionable insights, leveraging machine learning techniques for predictive analysis and reporting.
  - [Real Estate Insights: End-to-End ML Deployment](https://github.com/Pruthvish-Vyas/House_price_prediction): Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key features such as location, size, and amenities. Leveraged Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, and model development, and containerized the application using Docker for seamless deployment.
  - [Video Game Sale Predictor: Streamlit Deployment](https://github.com/Pruthvish-Vyas/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/end%20to%20end%20video%20game%20sales%20project/README.md): Developed a data science pipeline to analyze and predict video game sales based on historical data and key features such as platform, genre, and region. Leveraged Jupyter Notebook and Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization, delivering actionable insights through machine learning models.
 
- ## Data Analysis and ML Model Building
  - [Consumer Behaviour Analysis And Model Building](https://github.com/Pruthvish-Vyas/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Consumer%20Behaviour%20Analysis%20And%20Model%20Building): Designed a data science solution to analyze consumer behavior and build predictive models for actionable insights. Leveraged Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis and Python for implementing machine learning models to identify key trends and predict consumer actions.
  - [MSFT Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/Pruthvish-Vyas/Market-Trend-Prediction): Developed a machine learning model to predict the future stock prices of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using historical data.
