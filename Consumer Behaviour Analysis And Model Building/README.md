# Ecommerce Data Analysis And Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce shopping trends and building a machine learning model to predict customer behavior or other relevant outcomes. The project is divided into two main components:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset and uncovering insights.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Building and evaluating a predictive model using the dataset.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
```
ECOMMERCE/
    eda.ipynb               # Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis
    model.ipynb             # Jupyter Notebook for machine learning model development
    shopping_trends.csv     # Dataset containing e-commerce shopping trends
```

### 1. `shopping_trends.csv`
This is the primary dataset used in the project. It contains information about customer demographics, purchase behavior, and product details. Key columns include:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age, Gender, Location**: Demographic details.
- **Item Purchased, Category, Size, Color, Season**: Product details.
- **Purchase Amount (USD)**: Purchase value.
- **Review Rating, Subscription Status, Payment Method, etc.**: Additional customer and transaction details.

### 2. `eda.ipynb`
This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. Key tasks include:
- Loading and cleaning the dataset.
- Analyzing numerical and categorical features.
- Visualizing trends and patterns in the data.
- Preparing the data for machine learning by combining numerical and categorical features.

### 3. `model.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model. Key tasks include:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a decision tree model using parallel processing.
- Visualizing the difference between actual and predicted values.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics and visualizations.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze e-commerce shopping trends and uncover insights from the dataset.
2. To build an accurate machine learning model to predict customer behavior or other relevant outcomes.

## Scope
This project can be extended to:
- Explore additional machine learning algorithms for better accuracy.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
- Use advanced visualization techniques to present insights.
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions in an e-commerce platform.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the `eda.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset.
4. Open the `model.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

5. Alternatively, you can install all required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Experiment with deep learning models for improved predictions.
- Develop a web-based interface for real-time predictions.
